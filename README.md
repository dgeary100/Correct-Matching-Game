Your information: Devon Geary Intermediate Python 
Project type: Game 
Description of Application: You start in a forest scene, with several objects in front of you. 
Each object represents a new level of a matching game. The matching games have a theme based on 
the object representing them. The levels start at 6 cards and go up by 3 matches. Once your score 
hits the total number of matches, you are brought back to the forest to pick your next level.
Altered: Card game where the goal is to match the cards. It is a two player game, and you use 
the Q and O keys to flip a card from your pile, if your card matches the card on the top of the pile, 
then you press W or P, whichever is closer to your assigned key, to call a win. The game will identify 
a false win, if you press it on accident. After the pile runs out, the game ends. The goal is speed and 
accuracy.
