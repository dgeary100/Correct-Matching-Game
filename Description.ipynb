    "\tYou start in a forest scene, with several objects in front of you. Each object represents a new level of a matching game. The matching games have a theme based on the object representing them. The levels start at 6 cards and go up by 3 matches. Once your score hits the total number of matches, you are brought back to the forest to pick your next level.\n",

    "Altered: Card game where the goal is to match the cards. It is a two player game, and you use the Q and O keys to flip a card from your pile, if your card matches the card on the top of the pile, then you press W or P, whichever is closer to your assigned key, to call a win. The game will identify a false win, if you press it on accident. After the pile runs out, the game ends. The goal is speed and accuracy.\n",
